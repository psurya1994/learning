- Sara Solla at COSYNE2019 - Stable manifold dynamics underlie consistent execution of learned behavior ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0JRw1kTSIs))
  - Summary: Tries to answer, "is the neural dynamics of a learned motor behvaiour stable?" Problem: we can't do direct comparision because (i) we record only from a subset of neurons, (ii) we record from different neurons each day. Solution: realign the dynamics using ideas of matrix decomposition (SVD and stuff), and then check correlation for stability. Finding: the dynamics is stable. 
  - Learnt a number of new things, specially because I haven't explored talk like these before. The math was interesting, but didn't understand all of it. Got an overview though, can revisit if needed in future.
  - When the primates learn a task, it seems like they learn a manifold (through changing synaptic weights) that they keep getting back into. So they seems to learn this multimodal manifold activities that they choose based on tasks. It's interesting that they are "multi-modal" and not "smooth".
