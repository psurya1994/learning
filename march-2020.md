- Sara Solla at COSYNE2019 - Stable manifold dynamics underlie consistent execution of learned behavior ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0JRw1kTSIs))
	- Summary: Tries to answer, "is the neural dynamics of a learned motor behvaiour stable?" Problem: we can't do direct comparision because (i) we record only from a subset of neurons, (ii) we record from different neurons each day. Solution: realign the dynamics using ideas of matrix decomposition (SVD and stuff), and then check correlation for stability. Finding: the dynamics is stable. 
	- Learnt a number of new things, specially because I haven't explored talk like these before. The math was interesting, but didn't understand all of it. Got an overview though, can revisit if needed in future.
	- When the primates learn a task, it seems like they learn a manifold (through changing synaptic weights) that they keep getting back into. So they seems to learn this multimodal manifold activities that they choose based on tasks. It's interesting that they are "multi-modal" and not "smooth".
	- Surya Ganguli's bold hypothesis: "We observe *random* projection of an underlying dynamics when we record from a neuron"

- Konrad Kording - Why neuroscience needs deep learning theory ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgzRdQ5nm0U))
	- Read the related paper before, so was easy to grasp. Main learning: strong argument for bisexual reproduction over unisexual from evolution modeling. Bisexual takes O(sqrt(G)) time where as unisexual takes O(G)

- Anne Trafton - How the brain encodes landmarks that help us navigate ([link](https://bcs.mit.edu/news-events/news/how-brain-encodes-landmarks-help-us-navigate))
	- Summary: retrosplenial cortex shows phenomena similar to the hippocampus -- supressing activity (using optogenetics) leads to worse performance on the navigation task. RSC combines visual info with spatial info about it's own location to create "landmark" code. It combines viewpoint-dependent info (visual) with viewpoint-independent info (self location from hippocampus) in a non-linear fashion (some of response to info one at a time < response when both info is given). 
	- Learnt that the retrosplenial cortex works in harmony with the hippocampus to aid in learning and navigation. There are projections back and forth between each other. ([ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2733))

- Brain and consciousness Lecture 0  ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMWyA9OvKUM&list=PLJYRsbTsAfaoXNHCyoPbEQM-phunY7AtJ&index=1))
	- Differences between software and hardware of the brain. How any malfunction can be seen as a combination of both taking a specific example of functional movement disorders.

- Week 1 of ([link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/covid-19))
	- I wanted to learn the science behind this, this course doesn't seem to cover much of it.

March 18th 2020
- John M. Barry "The Next Pandemic: Lessons from History" ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9cmAahzVEc))
	- Predicts the pandemic and gives interesting insights. He's been thinking about these questions since earlier. 
	- Learnt: we need to invest more money into finding a universal vaccine for influenza.

- A practical summary of the covid-19 situation by Jeremy Howard ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY))
	- Masks help. We need: massive testing + masks + social distancing. South Korea was able to control the infections without lockdown! ICL made huge mistakes in modeling for UK, and UK made the wrong calls because of it. 
	- If I'm doing somehting that has an impact on lives of people, I need to do everything in my power to make sure it's accurate. This could include: getting people to verfiy my work, spending more time double checking myself, being honest about how confident I am about htese models, etc.
	- 5% of people my age need hospitalization. Which is scary given the estimates that 30% of the country will be infected.

- Viruses & How to Beat Them - Week 1 ([edX course link](https://www.edx.org/learn/immunology))
	- Learning basics of the micro world. Visiting atoms, molecules, organic chemistry, polarity in molecules, etc. Interesting stuff, finding them quite fascinating. Maybe I should schedule a call with people who work in this area.
