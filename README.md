# Learning: A repo of things I've explored daily

Need to mention why I'm doing this here. Talk about things like: 
- Building better inductive biases for my brain
- Honestly jotting down what I understand and what I don't
- To keep consistent streak
- Clearly leads to improvement. 
- Have a weekly meeting with Ravi who keeps me in check.
- Even if I don't understand, just watching it gives me better inductive biases.
- Intention is also to grab details efficiently not taking too long
- Intention is to spent more time thinking than just leanring. In general, I want thinking time to be more than watching.reading time.
